AIRD - AI Recollection Distillate Module Spec V1.5JNII
Section 1: Pronunciation and Purpose
AIRD is pronounced "arid," like a desert. It is a sparse, dry, human-readable, low-entropy subset of English designed for AI to summarize conversations into one pasteable module. This module can be decompressed later without losing the essence, enabling easy cross-thread carry.
Section 2: Mode Selection
Three modes based on intent:
Mode-B: Brief, 100-500 words.
Mode-S: Standard, default, 500-1000 words.
Mode-V: Verbose, 1000-10000 words, exempt from single subject rule.
Section 3: Encoding Process
i. Draft summary in normal English.
ii. Re-order to SOV (Japanese-style, e.g., "PP SM IF thing ASK").
iii. Paraphrase to lexicon words only (Section 5), proper nouns/acronyms exempt.
iv. Apply compression (Section 4).
v. Run ECC (Section 6); failure requires recompile.
Section 4: Compression Rules
LAW-PROTECT: Positions 1-3/4/6 (per mode) untouched post-Rule One.
RULE ZERO: Spec's 2487 letters write-protected.
RULE ONE: Drop doubles to singles (e.g., "good"→"god", "process"→"procs").
RULE TWO: Post-Rule One, drop vowels (y not vowel) beyond protected positions (e.g., Mode-S "distillation"→"distltn").
LEXICON EXCEPTION: Section 5 words as-is.
ACTORS: PP (person), AI (artificial intelligence), SM (system module).
RULE THREE: Numbers to digits (e.g., "nine"→"9").
RULE FOUR: Ratings: [IS/WAS/WILL][1-5]-[GOD/BAD][1-5] (1=speculative,5=certain; e.g., "IS5-GOD5").
RULE FIVE: Header(between singlepren):' =P^.^T=NNN.N.TopicName .C=YYYYMMDD.[Duration]-[Mode]^_^' (Topic max 20 chars; Duration: A=1min,B=1hr...Z=human civ end[append second letter, post hu civ; Zc=AI reminisces]). End =D. Grammar: SOV. AIRD Mode B & S modules are strictly single subject.

Section 6: ECC Validation
Run before output; failure=recompile.
CHECK 1: Doubles singled.
CHECK 2: Protected positions match post-Rule One.
CHECK 3: Consonants unchanged.
CHECK 4: Lexicon unmodified.
CHECK 5: Char count in () before =D.
CHECK 6: Length in mode range.
Errors: "technical"→"techncl" correct; "tchnl" wrong.
